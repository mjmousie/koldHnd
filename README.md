Texas holdem cold hand player in HTML, CSS and JS

Right now, this is just a basic cold hand meaning no actions (bet, check, raise, call, fold) can be performed.
It deals out a full Texas Holdem board (flop, turn, river) while also burning a card before each street.
The deck is shuffled 4 times before it deals out a hand.

I would like to add the following functionality in the future
1. Add chip stack functionality that shows player and opponent chip count
2. Add an action sequence (check, call, raise, or fold) preflop
3. Add action sequence (check, bet, raise, fold) to flop, turn and river
4. Add more animations (shuffle deck before hand, cards moving from deck to players preflop, cards flipping over on flop, turn and river)

Make sure to run `npm install` to install the dependancies pokersolver and underscore
